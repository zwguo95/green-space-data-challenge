# Green Space Data Challenge
This repository contains my code for the Green Space Data Challenge organized by the Massive Data Institute from the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. Access to green spaces is a fundamental necessity, and it has been widely recognized for its significant impact on the quality of life. Our project focused on analyzing the relationship between green spaces and community safety across different racial groups in Washington D.C., aiming to provide actionable recommendations for the D.C. government to enhance the utilization of these spaces. We are excited to be selected as a [first-place winner](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/pbi/the-green-space-data-challenge/) in this data challenge.
